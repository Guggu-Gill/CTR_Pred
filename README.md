3. Positional, Device, Connection bias- display position of add too biases the click rate, similarly type of device & connection speed. These biases affect user experiences & affect engagemnet.
eg- adds displayed on top have more proabablity to get clicked, similary larger device can too induce add click bias, also connection speed too.
